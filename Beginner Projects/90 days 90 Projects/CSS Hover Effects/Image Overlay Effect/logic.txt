Use the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements for the top and bottom bars of the overlay respectively. Set their opacity, transform and transition to produce the desired effect.

Use the <figcaption> for the text of the overlay. Set display: flex, flex-direction: column and justify-content: center to center the text into the image.

Use the :hover pseudo-selector to update the opacity and transform of all the elements and display the overlay.
