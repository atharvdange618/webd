Use a <figure> to wrap the <img> element and a <div> element that will contain the menu links.

Use the opacity and right attributes to animate the image on hover, creating a sliding effect.

Set the left attribute of the <div> to the negative of the element's width. Reset it to 0 when hovering over the parent element to slide in the menu.

Use display: flex, flex-direction: column and justify-content: center on the <div> to vertically center the menu items.
