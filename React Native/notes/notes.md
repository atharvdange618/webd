#### Why Expo?
Expo is a React Native framework designed for cross-platform development. It offers several benefits:
1. **File-based routing**: Simplifies navigation by using a folder structure for routes.
2. **High-quality universal libraries**: Includes pre-built libraries for common functionality across platforms.
3. **Plugin support**: Allows writing plugins to modify native code without directly managing native files.
4. **Recommendation from React Native**: The official React Native documentation recommends Expo as the default framework for new projects.

#### Understanding Folder Structure

1. **`app` folder**: Contains all the routes, pages, and screens.
2. **`assets` folder**: Stores all static files such as images, fonts, etc.
3. **`constants` folder**: Houses constant variables used across the project.
4. **`components` folder**: Contains reusable UI components.
5. **`hooks` folder**: Includes custom hooks to manage logic and reusable functionality.

#### File Based Routing

Expo follows file based routing where the file name is the route name
